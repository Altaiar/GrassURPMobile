i just did a little optimization on it and make it unlit to get more FPS on Moblie hardware
this demo tested on a Redmi 9T (1080 x 2340 pixels) i got around 30-40 FPS with renderscale 0.5 (around 720p) and with some upscaling in this case FSR1 u can getAway with Good frame and quality  because mostly mobile screens have high res Screens
there is a slider u can adjust the renderscale by it 
most of graphical features are turned off because of testing purposes so u need to active them Yourrself :)

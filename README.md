<br>
i just did a little optimization on it and make it unlit to get more FPS on Moblie hardware
<br>
this demo tested on a Redmi 9T (1080 x 2340 pixels) i got around 30-40 FPS with renderscale 0.5 (around 720p) and with some upscaling in this case FSR1 u can getAway with Good frame and quality  because mostly mobile screens have high Res Screens
there is a slider u can adjust the renderscale by it 
most of graphical features are turned off because of testing purposes so u need to active them Yourrself :)

Performance improvement Frame is always above 40 avg 45
UPDATE 1.3
Performance improvement by optimizing textures and more... Frame is 49 - 51
